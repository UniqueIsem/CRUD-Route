A splash screen will indoduce you to ROUTE, an Android aplication whose purpose is to generate motorcycle routes for bikers using Google Maps API, 
saving the information of the route as:
- user location (latitude and longitude)
- route location (latitude and longitude)
- route name
- route type
- route description
- route rating
- route files (images or videos)
All this information stored on a SQLite database and setted on a ListView where we can view the saved routes.
Besides the routes we have an inclination tool witch indicates to the user the inclination level for the curves on the road.

The goal for this aplication beta is to create a social media where bikers could upload and share routes with his community or friends.

This aplication implements multiple mobile tools as:
-  Splash screen
-  Google Maps API
-  Sensors
-  Data Storage
-  Camera
-  Firebase
-  SQLite
